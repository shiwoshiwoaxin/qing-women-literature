###  Xinyu Wang(Yara)

 ## Project Description
 Based on a multi-dimensional digital humanities study of 100 women writers in the Qing Dynasty, the study explores the development and spatial distribution of women's literature in the Qing Dynasty through the integrated use of social network analysis, geographic information systems, and data visualisation techniques.

 ## Research Achievements

 ### 1. Complete database
 - **100 female writers of the Qing Dynasty**：Detailed biographical files
 - **50+ data fields**: biography, works, family, social relations, etc.
 - **Time span**: about 300 years from the beginning of the Qing Dynasty (1585) to the end of the Qing Dynasty (1920)
  
 ### 2. Social Network Analysis
 - **Complex network of relationships**: literary friends, teachers and students, sing-song relationships
 - **Multiple types of connections**: same association, same place of origin, in-law relationship
 - **Visualisation**: building interactive network graphs using Gephi

 ### 3. Geographic distribution study
 - **HTML interactive map**: distribution of 100 writers by place of origin and activity
 - **Spatial analysis**: identification of literary centre regions
 - **Migratory trajectories**: visualisation of writers' activity ranges

 ### 4. Multidimensional analysis
 - **Literary genres**: Jiangnan Lady Poetry School, Sexual Spirit School, Changzhou Words School, etc.
 - **Social class**: official ladies, literati families, peasant girls, etc.
 - **Ethnic composition**: Manchu, Han and other multi-ethnic female writers

 ## Academic Value

 1. **Documentation preservation**: systematically collate information on women's literature in the Qing Dynasty
 2. **Pattern discovery**: revealing the structural characteristics of women's literary networks  
 3. **Spatial research**: exploring the geographical distribution of literature
 4. **Digital Methods**: Demonstrating the application of digital humanities in the study of traditional literature

 This project demonstrates how digital technology empowers the study of traditional literature and provides new perspectives and methods for the study of women's literature in the Qing Dynasty.
