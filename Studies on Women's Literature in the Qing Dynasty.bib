Using digital humanities technologies such as {CiteSpace} and {CNKI}'s visual analysis tools, we conduct a comprehensive search and analysis of the literature of women's literature studies. Emphasis is placed on analysing trends in the number of annual publications on the basis of a comprehensive review. In addition, we also analyzed the annual publication volume, journal publication volume, authors, research hotspots and national support of {CSSCI} (China Social Sciences Citation Index) source journals, objectively and scientifically reflecting the distribution of research power, changes in research hotspots and policy support for women's literature research. Through multi-dimensional and three-dimensional maps, we visually present the current situation of this topic and explore its possibilities for sustainable development from an archaeological perspective, providing new ideas for the interdisciplinary integration of women's literature studies in the Mediterranean region.},

清代盛行描繪個人的小照、小像，女性也不例外。不同類型的畫像，顯示了清代女性自我觀看、自我認知、自我定位的心理投射；而透過題詠自己的畫像，更突顯出清代女性自我書寫、自我形塑、自我呈現的主觀意志。從自己的畫像題詠中可以見到清代女性對於親族關係中的自我定位、自我形象的重塑建構、理想志趣的追尋等隱藏的心理層面。不同的形象顯示女性不一樣的自我定位，以及期望被他人理解的内在心性，也爲較少人留意的清代女性自我書寫提供了更豐富的面向。
Portraits became very popular in the Qing Dynasty, and many male scholars and female authors made “small pictures” or “small portraits”. Made by either oneself or others, the portrait and its included poem became part of the major “self-reinterpretation” channels for women in the Qing Dynasty. As the portrait recorded the female subject’s appearance and image and the poem demonstrated her spiritual contents, a full self-image was formed by combining these elements. Hence, the self-image, self-ideal, self-interest, and self-value of life of women in the Qing Dynasty are manifested in the portrait’s poem.},

	shorttitle = {Feminist Theories and Women Writers of Late Imperial China},
	abstract = {Feminism, feminist theory, feminist literary theory were already highly contentious in what they represented to Euro-American critics and theorists in the 1980s, when scholars in Chinese literary studies began sustained research on women writers in late imperial China (ca. 1600–1911). Their research drew on developments in Western feminist theories while problematizing certain applications. In this article, I review major debates in 1980s and 1990s Western feminist literary theory, divided by the different approaches of Anglo-American and French feminist critics and gender studies, examining why specific arguments on women and language, genres studied, and theoretical underpinnings did not hold significant relevance to the study of similar issues when applied to women's writing in pre-twentieth-century China. Yet certain concepts were highly fruitful in critical analysis. Feminist theory was never monolithic, even when it was Eurocentric; theories were drawn from a plurality of different disciplines and schools. Concepts that came into currency—gender, gaze, voice, agency, subjectivity, authorship, and so on—from poststructuralist, postcolonial, cultural, and film studies proved to be useful tools in feminist literary studies. Some came to be deployed in scholarship on women's literature in historical China. In this context, I reflect on theoretical approaches in significant studies of women's writing of late imperial China and consider the impact or critique this subfield of Chinese literary studies posed to Western feminist theories and broader questions of the applicability of modern/postmodern feminist theories to literature of earlier periods and other cultures before the globalization of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.},

	abstract = {清代女作家人數屬歷朝之冠，據胡文楷《歷代婦女著作考》指出，此時期的女作家多達三千多人，共同創作了極其豐富的著作數量。與此同時，女性著作的研究亦引起了學術界的熱烈關注與考究，女性筆下的內容觸及不同層面的主題，既有家庭生活的細緻描寫（如悼亡、夜讀等），亦牽涉不少關於社會、國家等內容，題材尤為廣泛，是非常珍貴的參考文獻。在眾多的議題下，病弱的才女形象似乎是各前輩學人的共識，女性筆下以「病」為主題的寫作內容亦甚為豐富。誠然，筆者嘗試對清代女性作品進行梳理，委實亦發現女性筆下亦涉及不少養生方面的教化。然而，從女性著作審視箇中所灌輸的養生之道，相關研究亦較為缺乏。養生即是保養生命以達至長壽，牽涉衣食住行、情緒管理、內在道德修養等等，箇中的議題尤為廣泛；而探究養生思想的人物更來自不同階層，是彌足珍貴的文化瑰寶。故此，本研究的主旨是針對女性著作所呈現的養生之道進行探究，而本文所選取的時限方面將集中在清代（1644-1912），因為清代是了解傳統思潮向新思潮過渡的重要時期，而此時期女作家亦共同建立了極其豐富的著作數量。女性著作是具備豐富議題的文獻，梳理其所灌輸的養生之道，除了可加深有關古代家庭中長輩教育內部成員的理解，也進一步呈現出女性著作內容的多元性；同時，清代女作家不論身負何種家庭成員的身分，誠然分享其養生經驗與看法，也有助於家族成員加以學習，對家族的繁衍甚有裨益，故此足證養生之道的探討也是家庭教育的重要一環，對家族的繁衍與傳承之效用委實不容忽視。},

	url = {http://ir.lib.ncu.edu.tw:444/thesis/view_etd.asp?URN=108181602},
	abstract = {本文以女性詞清代批評為研究對象。女性詞批評，即是對女性詞的批評。女性詞清代批評是指清代人以女性詞人或女性詞為對象，採詞選集、詞作評點、詞話、序跋、論詞詩詞、論詞文、書札等批評形式對女性詞所作的批評。
  本文對女性詞清代批評文獻進行綜述，從中可見清代論述女性詞的文獻形式和數量豐富、且批評者與批評對象的身份多元化，蘊含著豐富的詞學批評意義和性別文化內涵。在清代的不同階段，女性詞的批評形式和方式有所偏重和變化。通過論述女性詞清代批評的歷史脈絡，可見從宋代至明末：女性詞批評是從沉寂到漸起的過程。清代前期女性詞的創作與批評也隨著詞體創作的復興而興起，同時女性的詞學主體意識也在覺醒、發展。清代中期的女性詞批評也隨著詞學發展而蓬勃發展，這體現在女性詞批評文獻的多元、豐富與批評主體的身份多元化。清代後期（含民初），女性詞批評隨著詞學的繁盛而盛行，此時期具有批評主體的身份多元、批評對象的繁多、批評文獻的豐富與新變的特徵。在晚清民初的社會變動和新思潮影響下，女性詞批評也產生了與之相適應的新變，這個新變既有積極的一面，也有消極的一面並引起爭論。
  從清代女性詞的創作與批評的互動情況中，可見女性詞的創作和批評呈互相促進的關係，其次可見清人批評對清代女性詞具有的溢美傾向，再次清人具有將女性詞香艷化解讀的傾向。清人對女性詞批評書寫呈現出文學性，其中涵具女性詞接受的性別意涵和文化意義。清人對女性詞的批評書寫反映的詞學觀念，可歸納為價值論與創造論兩方面。
  在清代的父權文化語境下，清人不論是男性文人，還是才媛，對女性詞人「德、才、色、情」的論述，皆是以「男性凝視」的預設視角看待女性，即以男性文人的女性觀評論女性，其中灌注著男性文人對理想女性的心理追求。清人無論男性文人還是才媛關於女子「才命相妨」的論述與認同，涵具對才女薄命的憐惜以及情感投射，其中蘊涵著不同的性別意識。
  清人認為閨秀詞的本色是柔媚的風格。男性文人及部分閨秀推崇女性詞的「清雅脫俗」、「雄壯」等審美風格作為女性「非脂粉化」的詞學風範而大加揄揚，而摒棄了主流閨秀詞具有的柔媚的主體風格。其目的是提昇女性詞的地位，但皆是以男性為中心的批評視角評論女性詞。但也有閨秀如沈彩是從女性本來的性別特徵出發肯定女性詩詞的脂粉氣，具有女性主體意識。清人在女性詞評中對「林下風」和「丈夫氣」的揄揚，具有將女性詞人「名士化」和「丈夫化」的意涵，也就是將女性詞人「男性化」的審美接受，具有顛倒性別的批評內涵。另外，清代中後期對女性詞批評著意強調「溫柔敦厚」，雖然是對女性詞本色的審美接受，但也有依照傳統詩教觀要求女性詞創作的意味。這體現了以男性為中心的批評標準。
  通過梳理清代對李清照和朱淑真之批評接受，可見清代詞論對李清照和朱淑真是人品與詞品的糾纏接受，二者難以分割。朱淑真成了歷代文人寄託理想的才女型佳人形象的典型；而李清照是作為寄託一代女傑的理想才女形象的典型。從中可見清代文人尤其是男性文人的理想才女形象是「才德貌」三全或「才德識」三全。另外，清代人著重於對李清照、朱淑真的貞節翻案和肯定，則表明了清代注重道德的才女觀和注重人品的詞學批評觀。
  女性詞清代批評具有的價值及對後世的影響體現在：一是女性詞批評促進了女性詞的經典化；二是女性詞批評有助於女性詞史的建構和女性詞研究的開拓；三是女性詞的批評促進了女性詞的傳播和接受。},
