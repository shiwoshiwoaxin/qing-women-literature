### 1. Mandate fulfilment.
- Identified the research topic Creative Groups and Studies of Women's Literature in the Qing Dynasty in Digital Perspective
- Used Markdown to create the design document and research log for this study.
- Identified the core research question, digital methodology and initial literature sources.
- Installed VS Code, Zotero.
- Created a four sub-folder structure in Zotero. Used Google Scholar and searched with the keywords "Digital Humanities" "Chinese women's literature" "Qing dynasty". Eleven highly relevant Chinese and English papers were successfully screened and crawled into Zotero. And relevant keyword tags were added to all entries .

### 2.Problems encountered.
-  Not yet familiar with the specifics of Gephi and QGIS, need to schedule time to learn.
- The construction and visualisation of the relational network requires adequate data collection and digital tools. However, there is no way to complete the data organisation work yet, which requires time and effort.

### 3.Next steps.
- Go to the library and borrow the Examination of Women's Writings through the Ages.
- Study the introductory tutorials of Gephi and QGIS.
- Read and sift through Zotero's literature and take notes. For further use for your own research.
